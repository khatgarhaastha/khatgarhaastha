# Hi there! I'm Aastha Khatgarh 👋

<div class="github-introduction">

I'm an **AI Enthusiast** and **Data Explorer** with a passion for solving complex problems using cutting-edge technologies like **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. With a strong foundation in both backend and cloud services, I enjoy creating solutions that are **efficient**, **scalable**, and **impactful**. 

Currently, I am focused on building systems that automate processes, such as automating data extraction for the **Global Poverty Research Lab**, saving countless hours of manual work and accelerating research outcomes.

In addition to this, I am diving deeper into the world of **DevOps**, focusing on streamlining workflows and improving deployment efficiency using technologies like **AWS Lambda**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD Pipelines**.
