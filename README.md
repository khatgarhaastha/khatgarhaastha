<div class="github-introduction">

I'm an **AI researcher** and **ML engineer** passionate about solving real-world problems with Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, and cloud-native systems. From building automated PDF extraction pipelines for the Global Poverty Research Lab to deploying scalable model unlearning strategies using Docker and AWS Lambda, I enjoy crafting solutions that are efficient, ethical, and production-ready. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into DevOps and CI/CD to streamline end-to-end ML workflows.
